# shakespeare-ai1
Neural Network to write shakespeare sonnets.

Now have better results (see jyr20/shakespeare-ai2). The approach here does not include punctuation, and so involves some reformatting of output.

Sample:

"*Thy view sweet play'st taken thy view, time's still. 
Must none be shown write be any true true unear'd womb,
in you despise come raz'd heaven's tell be change slow,
well hell in worst head doting sight to dote his blood,
increase fears the leaves force men worms rain we do come,
hence slow by happy show keep me read my true new single grief.*"
